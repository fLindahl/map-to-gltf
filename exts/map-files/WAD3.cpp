//	Restrictions:  None... do whatever you want with this!
//
//	This is a basic WAD3 reader.  It converts all of the images in a WAD to PCX files.
//	Assumes the current working directory for output, but the function supports any old
//	directory.  I didn't want to bother with checking for the silly backslashes and such,
//	so that's your fun part :)
//
//	This code is completely unsupported, and was written purely for other people to
//	learn the WAD3 structure.  That said, it *does* work and is a useful tool all by
//	itself.  Of course the really cool stuff we do inside Wally, but that wouldn't be
//	so easy to duplicate here.  I will answer any reasonable questions about the 
//	format, or even anything else in this code, but I make no warranties about using
//	this as the base for another program.  IE, test the crap out of what you're 
//	coding and really make sure it's working the way it should be.  
//
//	I put this together in a short amount of time, so there may be bugs or such.  
//	It's also not very optimized, but it runs fast enough to not bother me too 
//	much :)  I am doing a *lot* of bounds checking, so make sure you keep that stuff 
//	in there.  It is always better to be safe than sorry, and you never know when 
//	something might be corrupt.
//
//	Since this code only reads data and doesn't actually write a WAD file (that's 
//	for you to play with <g>) it doesn't bother looking at some important items.  
//	Specifically, the WORD padding at the very end of a mip's data block.  This WORD 
//	padding isn't used for anything, but it HAS to be there.  Check out the pseudocode 
//	structure in the header file for more details there.  If you come up with a WAD3
//	creation utility, just make sure Wally and WorldCraft can load your WAD, and you'll
//	be good to go.
