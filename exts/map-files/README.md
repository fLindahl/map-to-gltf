Foreword from 2013
------------------
This article and source code was written in 2001 but I still get emails asking
for it.  I cannot answer questions about it because I haven't worked with .MAP
files for many years.  But I have relicensed the code under the MIT License and
am making it available for anyone that still wants to use it.

Strap on your seatbelts, we're going back in time to 2001...

Edited readme from 2001
-----------------------
I hope that you learn from the code and the article.  If you are
lazy, go ahead and use csg.exe instead of writing your own .MAP
file parser.

I take no responsibility for the programs, the information, the
source or anything else related to these files.  Use them at your
own risk.  I am not sure if you are even allowed to use the .MAP
file format or any .MAP tools for commercial projects.  If you
need to find out, ask id Software (http://www.idsoftware.com).  If
you need to know whether you are allowed to use WorldCraft for
commercial projects, please ask Valve Software
(http://www.valvesoftware.com).  For any other questions, feel
free to ask me at stefanha@gmail.com.

Enjoy
