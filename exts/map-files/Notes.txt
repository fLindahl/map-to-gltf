Current Application Status:
Loads and converts (most WorldCraft 3.3) .MAP files into .CMF files correctly.

TODO:
+ If passable geometry (ie. fog volumes, water, slime, etc.) is ever put into
  worldspawn, then the brushes will have to sort their contents in order to get
  CSG union to work correctly.  Otherwise an object inside water could disappear.
  This is not an issue if water is a separate brush entity.

+ There are still bugs if very complicated or degenerate geometry is passed
  to the program.  These problems could occur when you create many pseudo
  curved surfaces from arches (with many segments).  These bugs are due to
  floating point precision problems and can be fixed by tweaking the
  epsilon values appropriately.  Seriously degenerate geometry (which can be
  detected using WorldCraft's "Map | Check for Problems" command) will still
  not compile correctly.  This can be avoided by selecting "Fix" when
  WorldCraft detects degenerate geometry. 

+ The possiblity of memory leaks also exists, although during debug builds,
  Visual C++ is "supposed" to warn if there are memory leaks.  If a serious
  error occurs, they will probably be memory leaks (which doesn't really matter
  since Windows will free up any memory that a process has forgotten to free).
